#### COMP3104 - Developer Operations

[![CI](https://github.com/A-Shalchian/COMP3104/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/A-Shalchian/COMP3104/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Decided to go with Github Actions for CI/CD as it is free for public repositories and integrates well with GitHub, instead of Travis CI.
